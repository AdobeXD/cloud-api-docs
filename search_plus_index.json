The XD Cloud Content API will provide you with metadata and rendition URLs in a handy JSON response. Start coding Get your unique API key To communicate with XD Cloud Content APIs, you’ll need your own unique API key to send along with each request. You can get your API key by reaching out and telling us a little about the integration you want to build. Contact us "},"integrate.html":{"url":"integrate.html","title":"Integrate","keywords":"","body":"Integrate Thanks for choosing to integrate with the XD Cloud Content APIs. We have put together some helpful documentation here to help you get started on your integration. Quick start Endpoint References Samples "},"tutorials/quick-start.html":{"url":"tutorials/quick-start.html","title":"Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Quick Start: Make your first API call Let’s walk through making your first XD Cloud Content API call together. We'll keep things simple in this tutorial and use the command line tool cURL to make a request call. At the end of the tutorial, we'll suggest some next steps for going deeper with the XD Cloud Content APIs. Prerequisites Basic knowledge of Command Line Interfaces and APIs A text editor to write your code in (like VSCode, Sublime Text, Brackets, Atom, etc) Development Steps 0. Get a client ID and client secret Before you start, you'll want to request a client ID and client secret by filling out this form. If approved, you will be assigned a unique client ID and client secret, which can be used to make API calls. 1. Decide whether your app will access private cloud docs or not XD cloud documents are either private or public, depending on how the user has chosen to share them. If you are building an integration that requires access to private XD cloud ducments, your app will need an access token which can be obtained through an OAuth integration. During this OAuth workflow, users will be asked to authorize your app to access private cloud documents. API Key API Secret Access Token Public Cloud Docs Required Not Required Not Required Private Cloud Docs Required Required Required Note that if your app tries to access a private XD cloud document without an access token, Cloud Content APIs will return the following error: { \"error\": { \"message\": \"Wrong/Missing authorization information\" } } 2. Get the document URL You will need a document URL created from an XD document. In order to create a link, open Adobe XD and follow the steps below. First, click on the \"Share\" button at the top right corner and select \"Share for Review\": You will be asked to configure some settings. After choosing the right options for you, click on the \"Create Link\" button: After creating the link successfully, you will be able to copy the link to the clipboard: We'll use that link in the next step. 3. Find out what API endpoint can be used for a document URL Send an OPTIONS call and read the response header to learn what API calls can be made for a particular XD document URL. Refer to the required headers and parameters in the endpoint references page. curl -I -X OPTIONS -H \"x-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY\" -H \"X-AdobeXD-Link: https://xd.adobe.com/view/21652643-762a-41c6-5cd9-6342060e8aff-5754/\" https://xdce.adobe.io/v2/api This should return a response header like this: Access-Control-Allow-Headers →Origin, Content-Type, Accept, X-Api-Key, X-AdobeXD-Link, User-Agent Access-Control-Allow-Methods →OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Origin →* Access-Control-Expose-Headers →x-request-id, Content-Type, Content-Length, Link Connection →keep-alive Content-Length →0 Content-Type →application/json; charset=utf-8 Date →Mon, 14 Oct 2019 20:57:24 GMT Link →; rel=document Server →openresty Strict-Transport-Security →max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains Vary →Accept-Encoding X-Content-Type-Options →nosniff X-DNS-Prefetch-Control →off X-Download-Options →noopen X-Frame-Options →SAMEORIGIN X-Request-Id →gJeLsvCSjgTXhhDEp8uGMa0rnBrNeZXo X-XSS-Protection →1; mode=block The value of the Link key is the endpoint you can use to make further API calls. In this example, that value is: /v2/document/21652643-762a-41c6-5cd9-6342060e8aff-5754 4. Make a GET call to the document endpoint Now that you've retrieved the exact endpoint, you can make a GET call to the API. Refer to the required headers and parameters in the endpoint references page. curl -H \"x-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY\" https://xdce.adobe.io/v2/document/21652643-762a-41c6-5cd9-6342060e8aff-5754 This will return a JSON response that contains various data about the document, including the following and more: id name thumbnail publisher artboardCount artboards homeArtboardId version lastupdated history assetID includesDevelopmentData You can leverage this response data in your integration as-is. Or, in some cases, you can use the data to dig deeper. We'll look how to do that with the artboards data in the next step. 4. Make a GET call to the artboard endpoint The response we received above contains the artboards key with an array value of artboard objects. Each artboard object contains a unique id. You can use this value to make a GET call to the artboard endpoint. Note that you need to chain the artboard URL to the document URL used in the previous step. Refer to the required headers and parameters in the endpoint references page. curl -H \"x-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY\" https://xdce.adobe.io/v2/document/21652643-762a-41c6-5cd9-6342060e8aff-5754/artboard/5dec1809-bf44-4e9b-aef5-6e46e8aa18e9 This will return a response that contains various data about a given artboard, including: id name resourceAPI thumbnail bounds viewportBounds triggers parent Congratulations on making your first couple of calls to the XD Cloud Content APIs!

What rate limits are there on API calls? XD Cloud Content API integrations are limited to no more than 10 calls per second. Do artboard thumbnails (renditions) have a lifespan? Thumbnail URLs returned by the Cloud Content APIs are only live for 24 hours. Make sure that your application sends a new request to receive updated thumbnail URLs. Is it possible to access private XD cloud documents through these APIs? Yes, provided that the user grants you access via OAuth. However, it is important to note that only private cloud documents created by individual users are accessible. Private cloud documents created by enterprise users will be supported in the future. What happens if I request a cloud document that has been deleted? If the cloud document or its published link is deleted by the author, the API will return the following body in the response: { \"error\": { \"message\": \"Specified resource not found or not authorized\" } } "},"samples/":{"url":"samples/","title":"Samples","keywords":"","body":"Samples Vist our GitHub repo of code samples that demonstrate basic interaction with the Adobe XD Cloud Content APIs.
